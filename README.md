This is an experiment.  If it turns into something useful, I'll write a better readme.  It's called 'pst' because it's abot point set topology.

I want to capture the formal structure of a topology textbook in a... directed graph?  Where the nodes are axioms and theorems and the edges are... proofs?  And then (if the directedness of the graph isn't a problem), I want to use topological methods to reason about the structure of the textbook, and with a little luck, I could also reason about the structure of topology itself.

No promises at this stage.
